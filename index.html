    <h2>Grent Perez - Cherry Wine</h2>
    <p>Why you standin' all by yourself?

      <p>
        Those shoes were made for dancin' with someone else
      </p>

      <p>

      </p>Why don't we move over to that empty space?

      <p>I'll bet you twenty bucks I'll put a smile on your face</p>
    <p>I know a place where we can</p>
    <br>

    <p>Dance the night away
      Baby, we can try to
      Make the world spin slower</p>
    <p>We can take our time
      And get to know each other over cherry wine</p>
    <p>Well, it's too soon to give up on tonight, oh</p>
    <br>

    <p>I haven't had the chance to show you my moves and
      </p>
        I think you'd like to see why they would call me Mr. Dynamite
      </p>
      </p>
    <p>I can show you while we dance the night away</p>
    <br>


    <p>Baby, we can try to
      Make the world spin slower
      We can take our time</p>
    <p>And get to know each other over cherry wine
      I've been waitin' on this dance floor
      Made for two</p>


    <p>Won't you show me just what you can do?
      I don't wanna waste your time
      So please just have me for tonight?</p>
    <p>Dance</p>
    <br>

    <p>Yeah, I said, "Let's dance the night away"

      <br>
      Baby, we can try to
      Make the world spin slower
      We can take our time
      <br>   
      And get to know each other over cherry wine</p>
      <p>Oh, I, dance the night away

        Baby, we can try to

        Make the world spin slower</br>

        <br>We can take our time
        I know it's too soon to say, "You're mine" 
        But let's have a little drink tonight</br>

       <br>And get to know each other over cherry wine.
       But let's have a little drink tonight</br>

       <br>And get to know each other over cherry wine.
